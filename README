So ideally the application flow would be that we have
the ApplicationRunner which instantiates objects for
wrapper and the logical handler.  We will then wait
for relevant signals from the Input hardware wrappers
and if signals are received or some internal stimuli
is achieved, we process those signals.  If warranted
we then pass on the correct instructions to the 
outputter.

Ideally we want to make the classes we write as generic
as possible, with almost no hardcoding.  We will have
some sort of configuration file that would hold all of
config/settings that would need changing.  This would
make the project easier to maintain.
